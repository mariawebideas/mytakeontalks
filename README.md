# My Take on Talks
## What is this repo about?

This repo contains my notes of tech talks I attend. I focus mainly on Drupal meetings in London.

## Why have I started this repo?

After years of attending meetings I have a full box of scribbled notes I never look at again.
They contain information that I am sure will be very useful to me as a websites developer and designer.
However, it is impossible for me to find the information I look for without spending very valuable time shifting trough them;
and even if I find the correct piece of paper I might not even understand my own writing!

GitHub gives me also the opportunity to share these notes with others.

## Who is this repo for?

Mainly to site builders that use Drupal as their content management system.
