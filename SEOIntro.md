## Researching your Keywords
* Use [Google Trends] (https://www.google.es/trends/) to investigate whether people are interested in the product you intent to sell or the services you are going to offer.
* Start by optimising maybe three pages on your site targeting specific searches by potential customers.  E.g. Cupcake with rum cooking tips; people looking for this might explore your website further and buy your cupcakes. Do not optimise your home page as that page is usually very general.
* Be aware that people usually do searches with the following components: a qualifying word, a trade or product and an area; e.g. Professional plumber Ilford.
* Find a niche phrase keyword; ask your friends to brainstorm with you to create a big list.
* Use the google autosuggest tool (the dropdown that appears when you do a Google search)
* Use Twitter # hash tags; pretend you are writing a tweet and start the hastag with your chosen keyword. The autocomplete option will give you ideas for more keywords.
* Use [Ubersuggest] (https://ubersuggest.io/) and [Keyword Tool] (http://keywordtool.io/) to get more keyword ideas.
* You can also use [Google Keyword Planner Tool] (https://adwords.google.es/keywordplanner); you might need to add a credit card to use it.
* [Wordtracker] (http://www.wordtracker.com/) is the best paid for tool:
  * You can get a 7 days trial.
  * You can cut and paste all your keywords in the middle area of the tool.
  * On the left you will see a list of words and phrases that are similar to your keywords; use it to get more ideas
  * A KEI (Keyword Effectiveness Index) closer to 100 is the best; people are looking for those keywords but there is no much competition for them.
  * IAAT means In Ancher <a> And Title <title>
* If you find that people are looking for chocolate rice crispy cake do a page exactly for to cater for these searches
* Make sure to do a search for your chosen words, e.g.  cannibal cupcake is a model so do not use this phrase if you are selling cupcakes as people doing this search will be mostly looking for information on the model.

## Organising your Keywords
* In an Excel page have the following columns:
  * Your chosen keywords: a column with all your keywords
  * Web page 1 (the name of a page you are optimising): add here the keywords you will be using for this page. Copy and paste them here from the column Your chosen keywords.
  * Web page 2: as above
  * Web page 3: as above
* Now for each web page chose the best 2-3 keywords; each page focusing on different keywords.
* Wait for 4-6 weeks to review the results after optimising a page.

## Google sandbox
* for new websites google might show you up the organic rank very quickly 

## General Tips
* Check out [Google AdWords for Charities] (https://www.google.com.hk/intl/en/grants/)
* Check out [General Assembly] (https://generalassemb.ly/) as their courses are very good
* Use a browser with no cookies or empty your cache before you do a search in Google so it does not remember your history and offers you new search results
* Before you buy a domain investigate if someone has owned in the past.  Use the website [Open Link Profiler] (http://openlinkprofiler.org/), make sure that not doggy websites link to your domain.
* In the google analytics tracker put your IP address so it does not record your own visits.
