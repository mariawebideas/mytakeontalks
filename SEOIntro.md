Use Google Trends to investigate whether people are interested in the product you intent to sell or the services you intent to offer.

Check out Google AdWords for charities

Check out General Assembly courses as they are very good

Use a browser with no cookies or empty your cache before you do a search in google so it does not remember your history and offers you new search results

Start by optimising maybe three pages on your site targeting specific searches by potential customers.  E.g. Cupcake with rum cooking tips; people looking for this might explore your website further and buy your product. Mdo not optimise your home page as that page is very general.

Be aware that people usually do searches with a qualifying word, a trade or product and an area; e.g. Professional plumber Ilford

You need to find a niche phrase keyword; ask your friends to brainstorm with you.

Before you buy a domain investigate if someone has owned in the past.  Use the website openlinkprofiler.org, make sure that not doggy websites link to your domain.

Keyword Search
Use the google autosuggest
Use Twitter # hash tags; pretend you are writing a tweet and start the hastag with your chosen keyword. The autocomplete option will give you ideas for more keywords.
ubersuggest.org
keywordtool.io
Keyword planner tool from google; you might need to add a credit card to use it
Wordtracker is the best paid for tool.  You can get multiple 7 days trial if you use different email addresses.you can cut snd paste all your keywords in the middle area. On the left they will display a list of words and phrases that are similar, so you get more ideas" KEI: keyword effectiveness index; a KEI closer to 100 are the best because people are looking for them but there is no much competition.
If you find that people are looking for chocolate rice crispy cake do a page exactly for this
In ancher <a> and title <title> means IAAT
Search for your chosen words, e.g.  cannibal cupcake is a model so do not use this phrase if you are selling cupcakes as people doing this search will be mostly looking for the model

In an Excel page have the following columns
Your chosen keywords: column with all your keywords
Web page 1: the name of a page you are optimising, write here the keywords you will be using for this page. Copy and paste them here from the column Your chosen keywords.
Web page 2: as above
Web page 3: as above
Now for each web page chose the best 2-3 keywords. For each page you are trying to get people searching for different things 

Wait for 4-6 weeks to review thw results after optimising a page
In the google analytics tracker put your IP address so it does not record your own visits


Google sandbox: for new websites google might show you up the organic rank very quickly
